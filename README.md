#  LexisNexis UK which became LexisNexis was purchase by International Publishing Corporation (IPC). In 1970 Reed Group merged with IPC and under this new business formation a division of the company, 
   Heinemann was merged with Butterworths Scientic in 1990 wich became Butterworth-Heinemann. The Butterworths publishing business is now owned by Reed Elsevier Group (RELX). The amount paid for 
   LexisNexis is not known. 

#  Henry Butterworth was selling law books with his uncle Joseph Butterworth. After a disagreement with his uncle, Henry set up is own business of selling law books. The idea behind LexisNexis was to allowed     customers to find books without having a librarian assistance. In 1956 in Western Pennsylvania attorney John Horty began to explore the use of CALR technology.

#  The company's intended customer was anyone in need of buying a law book but later with the introduction the CALR technology with John Horty the concept was developed to assist hospitals throughout
   the US by keeping track all the administrative laws that governs the hospitals from state to state. Today millions of people throughout the world is using CALR technology
   
#  Today LexisNexis has many competitors like Experian, TransUnion, Accertify,Thompson Reuters and are many more. Currently Thomson Reuters has the biggest market share. They all provide similar products. They
   collect data on consumers.

   LexisNexis collects information from almost all public records sources such as real estate transaction, professional license information, historical addresses on file.

#  The impact of LexisNexis in the business world is major. Currently the company is servicing over 160 countries with millions of customers world wide. They among the leading global companies in providing 
    legal, regulatory and business information and analytics that can faciliate improvement in productivity and decision making process.

#   LexisNexis key core matrics to measure success is how they help the customers grow their business while making sense of the technology. Ultimately, their goal is to be able to reduce significantly the time
    employees spend on administrative tasks associated with marketing and business development work. Based on these matrics the company is doing well cause LexisNexis is considered among the top 3 companies in    the segment.

#   Currently Thompson Reuters, IBM Cognos Business Intelligence and Bloomberg are considered as the leading companies but LexisNexis is not far behind. Customers in the risk solutions business normally will 
    shop around and compare their products.  

#   If I was adivising LexisNexis on any other type of services it would be to gather information on customers behavior. 

#   This woud have allowed them to provide better services to their customers like IBM. Currently IBM collects data about customers, this method is not without controversies because collecting behevioral data
    on consumers has a negative connotation but as a company staying within the letters of law would be beneficial to the company.

#   It would be beneficial because it would allow them to compete better against companies like Bloomberg and IBM. Currently IBM with its business solution can create better reports, monitor events , and key
    metrics, and make better business decisions from their data; while LexisNexis is most experienced with business solutions offered. As they are the most experienced, their cost model tends to be towards the    higher end costomers. Therefore gathering more detail information about customers behavior would give LexisNexis a larger group of clientele.

#   This system method of data gathering would not lead to new products or services but it would lead to a larger pool of customers thus this could translate into higher revenue for the company.

#   As long as the company stays within the law on how to collect behavioral data on consumers I believe these technologies would be appropriate because they be able to provide better business solutions
    to the consumers, customer satisfaction would be higher and the competition would also be be better.
